# 💎 SmartGrade: AI-Based Diamond Grading System

SmartGrade is a deep learning-powered computer vision system designed to classify diamonds based on the 4Cs: **Cut**, **Clarity**, **Color**, and **Carat**. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model automates grading using image data — helping standardize diamond evaluation for the gem industry.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Diamond grading is traditionally done manually, which can be subjective and time-consuming. SmartGrade introduces an automated, consistent, and scalable approach to support professionals in diamond quality assessment.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **OpenCV**
- **CNNs** for image classification
- **Power BI** for performance analytics
- **Google Collab** for training workflows
- **Streamlit** *(optional)* for a user-friendly demo interface

## 📊 Features
- Image-based grading model trained on labeled gemstone data
- Independent models for each C (cut, clarity, color, carat)
- Performance metrics visualized in Power BI
- Optional web demo for real-time prediction
